++i: It is also called pre-increment and it adds 1 to the i variable
i++: It is also called post-increment and it adds 1 to the i variable
the difference between them is that pre-increment(++i) adds one to i variable and executes its line of code
but post-increment(i++) adds one to i variable and then executes the line of code
